** Forked from [THIS REPOSITORY.](https://github.com/nayuki/Reference-Huffman-coding) **

### Requirements:

- PyQt5

### What's changed?

- You can compress multiple files
- Compressed files name is equal with Decompressed
- a very simple GUI with PyQt5 for ease of use
- fix a little bug on `__str__` method in `CodeTree` Class

### Final Notes:

- I'm not good at grammar, so... Sorry if i can't tell what i mean
- The Main source support both python2 and python3 but i don't like python2 so i changed it to run only with python3 :D Sorry again :P
